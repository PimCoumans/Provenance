# Provenance
### An iOS Frontend for multiple emulators

###Why 'Provenance'?

I was looking for a word with a similar meaning to Genesis and came across Provenance:

> prov·e·nance  
> */ˈprävənəns/*  
> **Noun**  
> > 1. The place of origin or earliest known history of something: "a rug of Iranian provenance".  
> > 2. The beginning of something's existence; something's origin.
